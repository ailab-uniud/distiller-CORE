Evert POS pattern file is AS IS and, except for en-penn.json and 
it-tanl.json, are not guaranteed to be correct. In fact, except for these two files,
the other come from the previous iterations of the Distiller project (namely, 
dpie and dKOpie), and have not been tested with the current version of the software.

You may want to implement your own POS-tagger and use them in your own NGram 
generator (or ours, if you like); however, we don't guarantee the correctness
of the output if you use any POS-pattern database file other than the officially
supported files mentioned above.
